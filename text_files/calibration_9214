0	28	[12, 1, 28]	T5	T6	The T4 Protein1, also known as Protein2, is expressed predominantly in epithelial cells, in a variety of tumor cell lines, and in lymphocytes
0	3	[12]	T5	T4	The Protein2 Protein1, also known as T6, is expressed predominantly in epithelial cells, in a variety of tumor cell lines, and in lymphocytes
1	25	[19, 26]	T3	T2	The transmembrane T1 Protein2 interacts with Protein1
0	0	[18]	T1	T2	The transmembrane Protein1 Protein2 interacts with T3

0	0	[]	T6	T8	T5 specifically interacted with the general transcription factors Protein1, TBP, and T7 but not with TFIIEalpha in the Protein2 pull-down assays
0	0	[]	T7	T8	T5 specifically interacted with the general transcription factors T6, TBP, and Protein1 but not with TFIIEalpha in the Protein2 pull-down assays
0	20	[28]	T5	T8	Protein1 specifically interacted with the general transcription factors T6, TBP, and T7 but not with TFIIEalpha in the Protein2 pull-down assays
0	55	[19, 26, 27, 28]	T10	T9	TBP and Protein2, however, were not able to interact with Protein1
0	0	[]	T7	T6	T5 specifically interacted with the general transcription factors Protein2, TBP, and Protein1 but not with TFIIEalpha in the T8 pull-down assays
1	20	[28]	T5	T6	Protein1 specifically interacted with the general transcription factors Protein2, TBP, and T7 but not with TFIIEalpha in the T8 pull-down assays

0	0	[]	T3	T4	In contrast to Protein1, Protein2 did not interact with the AF2 domain of RXR
0	43	[12, 15, 18, 1, 27, 28]	T1	T2	Herein, we show that a distinct IkappaB protein Protein1 also interacts with RXR, as shown in the yeast two-hybrid tests and Protein2 pull-down assays
0	4	[11, 12, 18]	T13	T14	In addition, coexpression of Protein1 but not Protein2 further stimulated the Bcl3-mediated enhancement of the 9-cis-RA-induced transactivations of RXR
0	56	[11, 18, 26, 27, 28]	T12	T11	Accordingly, Protein2 coactivated the 9-cis-RA-induced transactivations of RXR, in contrast to the inhibitory actions of Protein1
