interleukin-1beta	5-lipoxygenase	32	ABCDK2RS	10022882
effects of the inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase 1 or 2 or 5-lipoxygenase on the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis induced by [interleukin-1beta] in the male rat.

il-4	interleukin-4	61	ABCDEFKL2R	10080532
interleukin-4 (il-4) -524ct polymorphism has been implicated to alter the risk of colorectal cancer (crc), but the results are controversial

mdm2	p53	96	ABCDEL2RSRSRSRSR	
[mdm2] isoform b ([mdm2]-b), the [mdm2] isoform most frequently over-expressed in human tumours, interacts with full-length [mdm2] to inhibit [mdm2]-mediated mutp53 degradation, promoting mutp53 accumulation and gof in tumorigenesis

p50	p65	80	ABCDEFKNQ1RSR	10080875
[p50] binds to both nf-b sites at 1 h following il-1 exposure, but is replaced at 2 h by p65 in a549 cells and by a [p50]/p65 heterodimer in hbe cells

traf2	cd40	59	ABCDEFKLN2R	
cd40 signaling induces irak1 sumoylation in the presence of tnf receptor-associated factor 2 (traf2) and intracellular isoform of osteopontin (iopn) whereas tlr4 signaling provides ifn regulatory factor 5 (irf5) as a chaperone for sumoylated irak1 nuclear translocation
